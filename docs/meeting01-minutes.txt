Discussion

Use python for coding- helpful with matrices

Terminal interface (may decide to add GUI later on)

Use Github to share code

Output- rank order ddx of diseases

Limited to 10 diseases



P(D|M) = P(D) + P(M|D)

                      P(M)



Evoking Strength= PPV

Specificity /Sensitivity

Impact Factor

Prevalence



Definitions:

-Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate, or the recall rate in some fields) measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition)

-Specificity (sometimes called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition)

Assignment (from OAK)

Assignment Description:  Create clinical decision support systems (1 per team) using either Internist-I algorithm (Team 1) or Bayesâ€™ Rule (Team 2)



Due in approve 4-6 weeks from data of assignment.  Special session to be arranged for review of results.



The system will take as input finding names (correctly spelled)

The finding names are the names from the two text files provided:

                        Diseases_for_2015_decision_support_exercise_copy.txt, and

                        Findings_for_2015_decision_support_exercise.txt



Each finding will be preceded by a plus (+) sign or a minus (-) sign (as entered by the user) to indicate that the finding is present or absent in the case.

When a dollar ($) sign is input, the system will generate a rank-ordered differential diagnosis for the diseases that are named in the file Diseases_for_2015_decision_support_exercise_copy.txt



Note that there are 10 diseases identified in the diseases file.

Therefore, for this exercise, a master differential diagnosis list would contain

a maximum of 10 diseases:



DATA file (knowledge base) structure:



(A) PDF file showing 10 diseases and their prevalences



(B) Diseases_for_2015_decision_support_exercise_copy.txt

Example:

TUBERCULOSIS CHRONIC PULMONARY

MX 02 198 AGE 16 TO 25

MX 03 199 AGE 26 TO 55

MX 03 200 AGE GTR THAN 55

MX 12 208 ALCOHOLISM CHRONIC HX



For MX 12 208 ALCOHOLISM CHRONIC HX:

MX

1 =     PPV (0 to 5 scale)

2 =     Sensitivity (1 to 5 scale)

208 = Finding number (always 3 or 4 digits)

ALCOHOLISM CHRONIC HX = Finding name





(C) Findings_for_2015_decision_support_exercise.txt

Example:

MX 1021 CONJUNCTIVA AND/OR MOUTH PALLOR

IM 2

TY 3



MX

1021 = Finding Number

CONJUNCTIVA AND/OR MOUTH PALLOR = Finding Name

IM =    Import (a single digit number from 1 to 5)

TY =   Type (NOTE:  TYPE IS NOT USED IN THE CURRENT EXERCISE)
